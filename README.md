# Learn Claude Code -- Harness Engineering for Real Agents

### The Mind Shift: From "Developing Agents" to Developing Harness

A harness is everything the agent needs to function in a specific domain:

```
Harness = Tools + Knowledge + Observation + Action Interfaces + Permissions

    Tools:          file I/O, shell, network, database, browser
    Knowledge:      product docs, domain references, API specs, style guides
    Observation:    git diff, error logs, browser state, sensor data
    Action:         CLI commands, API calls, UI interactions
    Permissions:    sandboxing, approval workflows, trust boundaries
```

### Why Claude Code -- A Masterclass in Harness Engineering

Look at what Claude Code actually is, stripped to its essence:

```
Claude Code = one agent loop
            + tools (bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep, browser...)
            + on-demand skill loading
            + context compression
            + subagent spawning
            + task system with dependency graph
            + team coordination with async mailboxes
            + worktree isolation for parallel execution
            + permission governance
```

## The Vision: Fill the Universe with Real Agents

**Bash is all you need. Real agents are all the universe needs.**

                    THE AGENT PATTERN
                    =================

    User --> messages[] --> LLM --> response
                                      |
                            stop_reason == "tool_use"?
                           /                          \
                         yes                           no
                          |                             |
                    execute tools                    return text
                    append results
                    loop back -----------------> messages[]


    That's the minimal loop. Every AI agent needs this loop.
    The MODEL decides when to call tools and when to stop.
    The CODE just executes what the model asks for.
    This repo teaches you to build what surrounds this loop --
    the harness that makes the agent effective in a specific domain.
```

**12 progressive sessions, from a simple loop to isolated autonomous execution.**
**Each session adds one harness mechanism. Each mechanism has one motto.**

> **s01** &nbsp; *"One loop & Bash is all you need"* &mdash; one tool + one loop = an agent
>
> **s02** &nbsp; *"Adding a tool means adding one handler"* &mdash; the loop stays the same; new tools register into the dispatch map
>
> **s03** &nbsp; *"An agent without a plan drifts"* &mdash; list the steps first, then execute; completion doubles
>
> **s04** &nbsp; *"Break big tasks down; each subtask gets a clean context"* &mdash; subagents use independent messages[], keeping the main conversation clean
>
> **s05** &nbsp; *"Load knowledge when you need it, not upfront"* &mdash; inject via tool_result, not the system prompt
>
> **s06** &nbsp; *"Context will fill up; you need a way to make room"* &mdash; three-layer compression strategy for infinite sessions
>
> **s07** &nbsp; *"Break big goals into small tasks, order them, persist to disk"* &mdash; a file-based task graph with dependencies, laying the foundation for multi-agent collaboration
>
> **s08** &nbsp; *"Run slow operations in the background; the agent keeps thinking"* &mdash; daemon threads run commands, inject notifications on completion
>
> **s09** &nbsp; *"When the task is too big for one, delegate to teammates"* &mdash; persistent teammates + async mailboxes
>
> **s10** &nbsp; *"Teammates need shared communication rules"* &mdash; one request-response pattern drives all negotiation
>
> **s11** &nbsp; *"Teammates scan the board and claim tasks themselves"* &mdash; no need for the lead to assign each one
>
> **s12** &nbsp; *"Each works in its own directory, no interference"* &mdash; tasks manage goals, worktrees manage directories, bound by ID

## The Core Pattern

```python
def agent_loop(messages):
    while True:
        response = client.messages.create(
            model=MODEL, system=SYSTEM,
            messages=messages, tools=TOOLS,
        )
        messages.append({"role": "assistant",
                         "content": response.content})

        if response.stop_reason != "tool_use":
            return

        results = []
        for block in response.content:
            if block.type == "tool_use":
                output = TOOL_HANDLERS[block.name](**block.input)
                results.append({
                    "type": "tool_result",
                    "tool_use_id": block.id,
                    "content": output,
                })
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": results})
```
